# RingCX SDKs

The following SDKs provide developers with libraries that make interfacing with RingCX APIs easier in your language of choice.

## Client SDKs

Client SDKs provide a native language interface to RingCX REST APIs

* [JavaScript Client SDK](https://github.com/ringcentral/engage-voice-js)
* [Python Client SDK](https://github.com/ringcentral/engage-voice-python)
* [EngageVoice.Net Client SDK](https://github.com/ringcentral/EngageVoice.Net)
* [Java Client SDK](https://github.com/ringcentral/engage-voice-java)

## Mobile Framework

The following Mobile Framework was built to show how a developer could build an agent experience on a mobile device to integrate with RingCX. This example utilizes the [RingCX Embeddable](https://github.com/ringcentral/engage-voice-embeddable) within Cordova, a mobile development framework. Since the Embeddable uses standard web technologies, this makes Cordova a great fit for packaging the Embeddable for distribution across iOS and Android app stores. A separate Web Server is expected to host the static web components including the HTML page and JavaScript code. That JavaScript code then communicates to the RingCX platform in the cloud.

To keep things local to a single development environment, Ngrok is used to tunnel web requests (to the Embeddable page) to a local web server. This way, your Embeddable's interface is presented by Cordova. We also deploy Cordova on a local simulator that can communicate to your local web server (running Embeddable) which then communicates to RingCX. Now you can customize your app to use RingCX services either by creating a different web technology experience via you web server or by customizing the Embeddable to integrate with other applications like CRMs.

## Community SDKs

There are currently a set of unofficial client SDK libraries built the developer community. The list below includes SDK wrappers for RingCX Platform APIs.

If you’ve built your own RingCX library, plugin, or open source app, please [get in touch](mailto:devsupport@ringcentral.com) and we’ll add it to this list.

Some of these integrations may be incomplete. Feedback and bugs should be directed to their representative authors.

### Node JS

* [engagevoice-sdk-wrapper](https://github.com/pacovu/engagevoice-sdk-wrapper-node) - A simple SDK wrapper to login RingCentral platform (using Password Flow authentication) and exchange for an RingCX access token.
