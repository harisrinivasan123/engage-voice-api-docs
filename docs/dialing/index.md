# Introduction to Dialing APIs

<img class="img-fluid" width="100%" src="../images/dialing-components.png">

Outbound calling activities can be planned and managed effectively using RingCX dialing components. They are not only helping a business determine objectives of outbound calls, but also ensure high agent performance, great customer service and deliver quality reports.

-   Dialing groups determine the dialing mode - this is the "How" a call will be made.

-   Campaigns are nested within the dialing groups, and are the reasons for calling - this is the "Why" we are calling.

-   Leads are the contacts, the people or the customers we are dialing - this is the "Who" we are calling.

-   Dispositions allows agents to mark the outcomes of a call - this describes "What" happened on that call.

As you can see dialing components are comprised of several different components that need configuration. To create them via UI interfaces will take a lot of time and navigation. The Campaigns, Leads and other related APIs provide useful functionality to fully or partially automate the creation of outbound dialing components programmatically. This is even more important to automate, when it comes to importing data from other data sources, e.g. importing leads information from your own CRM system.
