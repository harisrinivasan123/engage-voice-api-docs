# About Searching for Leads

You can search for leads using Primary Search Fields and Extended Search Fields. The Primary Search Fields can be used for performing basic searches on leads such as the campaign or list they are found in, while the Extended Search Fields provide search parameters that you can use to get more granular with your lead search.

## Primary Search Fields
The primary search fields include a selection of basic search parameters. You can search for leads by campaign, or you can search only for leads whose status is SUPPRESSED. You can look for leads that have been orphaned, or you can search for leads by loaded lists, according to disposition, or whether they were inserted by an agent or supplied by the system.
