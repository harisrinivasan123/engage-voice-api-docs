# Agent JavaScript Quick Start

Welcome to the RingCX Platform.

In this Quick Start, we are going to read a list of agent groups for an account. Let's get started.

## Create an App

The first thing we need to do is create an app in the RingCentral Developer Portal. This can be done quickly by clicking the "Create RingCX App" button below. Just click the button, enter a name and description if you choose, and click the "Create" button. If you do not yet have a RingCentral account, you will be prompted to create one.

<a class="btn-link btn-collapse" data-toggle="collapse" href="#create-app-instructions" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="create-app-instructions">Show detailed instructions</a>

<div class="collapse" id="create-app-instructions">
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/login.html#/">Login or create an account</a> if you have not done so already.</li>
<li>Go to Console/Apps and click 'Create App' button.</li>
<li>Give your app a name and description, then click Next.</li>
<li>On the second page of the create app wizard enter the following:
  <ul>
  <li>Select 'Private' for Application Type.</li>
  <li>Select 'Server-only (No UI)' for Platform Type.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li>On the third page of the create app wizard, select the following permissions:
  <ul>
    <li>ReadAccounts</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>We are using Password Flow authentication, so leave "OAuth Redirect URI" blank.</li>
</ol>
</div>

When you are done, you will be taken to the app's dashboard. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret. We will be using those momentarily.

## Read Agent Groups for a RingCX Account

### Install RingCX SDK Wrapper for Node JS

```bash
$ npm install engagevoice-sdk-wrapper --save
```

### Create and Edit list-agent-groups.js

Create a file called <tt>list-agent-groups.js</tt>. Be sure to edit the variables in ALL CAPS with your app and user credentials.

```javascript
const engagevoice = require('engagevoice_sdk_wrapper')

RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTID = '<ENTER CLIENT ID>'
RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTSECRET = '<ENTER CLIENT SECRET>'

RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME = '<YOUR ACCOUNT PHONE NUMBER>'
RINGCENTRAL_PASSWORD = '<YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD>'
RINGCENTRAL_EXTENSION = '<YOUR EXTENSION, PROBABLY "101">'

var evsdk = new SDK({
      clientId: RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTID,
      clientSecret: RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTSECRET
  });

var evsdk = new engagevoice.EngageVoice(RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTID, RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTSECRET)
  ev.login(RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME, RINGCENTRAL_PASSWORD, RINGCENTRAL_EXTENSION, function(err, response){
      if (err)
        console.log(err)
      else{
        list_account_agent_groups()
      }

  })

function list_account_agent_groups() {
    var endpoint = 'admin/accounts/~/agentGroups'
    evsdk.get(endpoint, null, function(err, response){
        if (err)
            console.log(err)
        else {
            var jsonObj = JSON.parse(response)
            console.log(jsonObj)
        }
    })
}
```

### Run Your Code

You are almost done. Now run your script.

```bash
$ node list-agent-groups.js
```
