# Introduction to Call Recordings

Call recordings can be retrieved as single channel (mono) recordings or as dual channel (stereo) recordings, also known as [Agent Recordings](https://support.ringcentral.com/engagevoice/admin/voice-admin-set-up-agent-recording.html).  

### Single Channel Recordings (Mono)

Call recordings are the audio files of the call. You can retrieve single channel (mono) call recordings using the [End Call Event](../../notifications/wfm/payload-wfm.md#end-call-events). If you miss the event or wish to just manually retrieve the call details, you can also use the [Global Call Type Detail](../../analytics/reports/global-call-type-detail-report.md#call-recordings) report.

If a call is answered and recorded, a call recording link will appear in the event, or as part of the report, under `recording_url`. Use this link to retrieve the call recording.

    ```

!!! important
    While the recording URL is sent 1-3 seconds after a call is ended, the actual recording takes more time to encode. Depending on the length of the recording, the recording link may not be valid for up to 1-2 minutes after the end call event.


### Agent Recordings (Stereo, Dual Channel)

Dual channel (stereo) agent recordings can also be retrieved from the [Agent Segment Metadata Report](../../analytics/reports/agent-segment-metadata-report.md). You can find the agent recording from the `Segment Recording URL` field in the downloaded report.  Note that the agent recording is a `perspective` type recording and must be set manually.
