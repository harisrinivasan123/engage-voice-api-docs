# About IVR

An IVR (Interactive Voice Response) is an automated system that can answer calls and perform actions like playing recordings, receiving input, and routing calls.

With the platform’s [IVR Designer](https://support.ringcentral.com/engagevoice/admin/voice-admin-intro-ivr-designer.html), you’ll have the ability to create IVRs from the most basic to complex using IVR Studio’s drag-and-drop interface.

While we provide a number of tools and opportunities for IVR customization, our system is designed to be intuitive. Think of an IVR as a dynamic, interactive flowchart that you can custom-build to guide customers through your desired pathways. With just a little practice, anyone can build a basic IVR in minutes.

However, there are instances where you need to invoke an endpoint, or you need to process the response in JavaScript. This can be done with WWW Node and Scripting Node within the [IVR Studio](https://support.ringcentral.com/engagevoice/admin/voice-admin-intro-ivr-studio.html).

In the following sections, we'll show you how to use the following nodes from a developer's point of view.

* [WWW node](www-node.md)
* [Scripting node](scripting-node.md)
